> **Note:** The steps below assumes that you have forked and cloned the [react-play](https://github.com/reactplay/react-play) repository. Also, you have installed the dependencies using the `npm install` or `yarn install` command. If you are new to forking, please watch this [YouTube Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8suY-Osn8Q) to get started.

- Run the application using 
  ```bash
  yarn start
  #OR

  ```

  If you face dependency issues, then try running this command:
  ```bash
  npm install --legacy-peer-deps
  ```
